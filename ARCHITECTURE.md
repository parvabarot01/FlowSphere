# Architecture

Living document, updated every sprint. Sprint 1 covers the database schema and RLS model. API surface and agent design are added in Sprint 2.

## Multi-tenancy model

Every tenant is an `organization`. A user's access to everything else — projects, sprints, tasks, the audit log — is derived from their row in `org_members`. There is no separate tenant-scoping mechanism beyond Postgres RLS: every table that holds tenant data carries an `org_id` column, and every policy checks membership through it. `projects`, `sprints`, and `tasks` all denormalize `org_id` directly (rather than requiring a join through `projects`) so RLS policies stay simple, single-table checks instead of subqueries — cheaper to plan and easier to audit.

## Database schema (`supabase/migrations/20260704000001_core_schema.sql`)

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `profiles` | Mirrors `auth.users` 1:1; created automatically by the `on_auth_user_created` trigger. Holds display name/avatar/email — the only user data safe to read across org boundaries. |
| `organizations` | A tenant. Has a unique `slug` for URLs. |
| `org_members` | Join table between `profiles` and `organizations`, carrying `role` (`owner` / `admin` / `member`). This row's existence *is* the access grant. |
| `projects` | Belongs to one org. |
| `sprints` | Belongs to one project (and, denormalized, one org). |
| `tasks` | Belongs to one project, optionally assigned to a sprint and/or a profile. |
| `audit_log` | Append-only. No update/delete policy exists for any role — entries can never be edited or removed once written. |

## RLS design

Two SECURITY DEFINER helper functions do the membership lookups so policies stay one-liners and so `org_members`' own policies don't recurse into themselves:

- `is_org_member(org_id)` — is the caller a member of this org, any role.
- `get_org_role(org_id)` — the caller's role in this org, or null.
- `shares_org_with(user_id)` — do the caller and this other user share any org (used to scope `profiles` reads).

Role gating in Sprint 1: any active member can create/edit projects, sprints, and tasks; only `owner`/`admin` can delete a project, manage membership, or change org settings; only `owner` can delete the org itself.

### The org-creation bootstrap problem

`org_members`' insert policy requires the caller already have `owner`/`admin` role in that org — which is impossible for a brand new org with no members yet. This is solved with a SECURITY DEFINER RPC, `create_organization_with_owner(name, slug)`, that inserts the organization row and the creator's `owner` membership row in a single transaction, bypassing RLS by virtue of running as the function's (table-owning) role. The app calls this RPC instead of inserting into `organizations` directly.

### Audit log integrity

`audit_log` has a `select` policy for org members but deliberately **no insert policy** for the `authenticated` role. All writes go through `log_audit_event(org_id, action, entity_type, entity_id, metadata)`, a SECURITY DEFINER function that stamps `actor_id` from `auth.uid()` server-side. This means a client can never forge an audit entry under someone else's name, and never write one directly — only through this trusted gateway. Feature code (invites, task mutations, approvals, etc.) calls this RPC as part of its own mutations rather than writing to `audit_log` directly.

## Free-tier ceilings to watch

- **Supabase free tier:** 500MB database, 5GB bandwidth/month, project pauses after 1 week of inactivity (auto-resumes on first request, with a cold-start delay).
- **Resend free tier:** 3,000 emails/month, 100/day.
- **Upstash free tier:** 500K commands/month (Redis), 500 messages/day (QStash).
- **Groq free tier:** rate-limited requests/tokens-per-minute, varies by model — the department-agent framework in Sprint 2 needs to queue/backoff around this rather than fan out requests freely.

None of these are close to being hit at Sprint 1 scale; noted here so Sprint 3's hardening pass has a baseline to check against.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push and PR to `main`: install, lint, typecheck, build. This needs no external account and is wired up as of Sprint 1.

Production hosting is Vercel, which deploys straight from this GitHub repo — but connecting a repo to Vercel is a one-time action tied to a personal Vercel account, so it can't be scripted from here. To finish this half:

1. Go to vercel.com → **Add New Project** → import this GitHub repo (`parvabarot01/FlowSphere`).
2. In the project's **Environment Variables** settings, add the same keys listed in `.env.example` (Supabase, Upstash, Groq, Resend) once those services are set up.
3. Vercel then auto-deploys a preview on every PR and promotes `main` to production on merge — no further setup needed.
